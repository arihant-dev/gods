# 🧠 GoDS

A personal project to **rebuild GoDS (Go Data Structures)** completely from scratch — to learn and master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Go** through hands-on implementation.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build a comprehensive and educational library of **data structures and algorithms** from first principles — entirely handwritten in Go.  
This project draws inspiration from [**emirpasic/gods**](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods) but follows the **natural DSA learning sequence** — starting from fundamentals and progressing to advanced concepts.

## 🧩 Learning Roadmap (Phased Approach)

### **Phase 1 — Linear & Foundational Structures**
> Core building blocks that establish fundamentals

- [x] Setup Go module & base folder structure  
- [ ] ArrayList  
- [ ] LinkedList (Singly / Doubly)  
- [ ] Stack (Array-based, List-based)  
- [ ] Queue (Array-based, List-based)  
- [ ] Deque (Double-ended queue)

---

### **Phase 2 — Trees & Hierarchical Structures**
> Learning ordered and self-balancing data organization

- [ ] Binary Tree  
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (BST)  
- [ ] AVL Tree  
- [ ] Red-Black Tree  
- [ ] BTree  
- [ ] TreeMap  
- [ ] TreeSet  

---

### **Phase 3 — Heaps & Priority Structures**
> Efficient retrieval of extreme elements

- [ ] MinHeap  
- [ ] MaxHeap  
- [ ] PriorityQueue  

---

### **Phase 4 — Hashing, Maps, and Sets**
> Fast lookup and key-based storage

- [ ] Hash Function Design  
- [ ] HashMap (Separate Chaining)  
- [ ] HashSet (built on HashMap)  
- [ ] Dynamic Rehashing  
- [ ] Open Addressing (optional)  

---

### **Phase 5 — Graphs, Tries & Advanced Topics**
> Abstract data models and optimized searching

- [ ] Graph (Adjacency List / Matrix)  
- [ ] BFS / DFS  
- [ ] Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- [ ] Union-Find / Disjoint Set  
- [ ] Trie (Prefix Tree)  
- [ ] LRU Cache  
- [ ] Bloom Filter  

---

### **Phase 6 — Algorithms & Utilities**
> Applying data structures to real algorithmic problems

- [ ] Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)  
- [ ] Searching (Linear, Binary)  
- [ ] Recursion Examples  
- [ ] Dynamic Programming Basics  
- [ ] Greedy Techniques  
- [ ] Graph Algorithms (MST, Shortest Path)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (1.23+)  
- **Testing:** Go’s `testing` package  
- **Docs & Demos:** GoDoc + Examples  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  
- **Inspiration:** [emirpasic/gods](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods)

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand **core data structure logic** and trade-offs  
- Strengthen algorithmic thinking & problem-solving  
- Write **idiomatic and test-driven Go code**  
- Learn **Go generics** and interfaces effectively  
- Build reusable, educational code that mirrors industry-level design

## 🧩 Inspiration

This project is inspired by [**GoDS (Go Data Structures)**](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods) — a clean and elegant open-source implementation of classical data structures in Go.  
However, this version is **reconstructed from the ground up**, following an educational trajectory and modern Go practices (e.g., generics, tests, benchmarks, and comments explaining the logic behind every function).
